Python data
- Describe how a list work under the hood
-  Dynamic array or pointer
-
What happened when the list is nearly full and when u want to add object to it

Are list restricted to any data types

No, it can store anything which is a ptr to the object itself

Describe how python dict work under the hood

Describe hash collision, and how new key and value pair get stored

How generator works

How to write a python decorator

Asyncio, how it work
Event loop and coroutine

Why is asyncio preferred over multi threading
- Additional overhead of spawning new thread and latency

Why is python slow when multi threading is involved
- GIL

Time complexity of most sorting algo

Time complexity of worst naive sorting algo

Code snippet , output

How is memory managed in python and what kind of python obj can be used in dictionary

What this code expect to do and how much can u improve it

Hackkerank
- Name , list of scores, less than 3 out of ten out of the scores, each score has a weighting , and determine if they pass or not
- Input file format,  why might it be slow

Different between diff python variables ? Set vs dict
Different ways to generate a list

List vs generator
