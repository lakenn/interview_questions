Topics
Companies
Hint
You have a grid of size n x 3 and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors: Red, Yellow, or Green while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same color (i.e., no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color).

Given n the number of rows of the grid, return the number of ways you can paint this grid. As the answer may grow large, the answer must be computed modulo 109 + 7.


Input: n = 1
Output: 12
Explanation: There are 12 possible way to paint the grid as shown.
Example 2:

Input: n = 5000
Output: 30228214
